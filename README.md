Long Trade Conditions:
If the price falls below the lower Bollinger Band and then rises above it, the bot opens a long position.
If the price crosses above the moving average, the bot closes the long position.
Short Trade Conditions:
If the price rises above the upper Bollinger Band and then falls below it, the bot opens a short position.
If the price crosses below the moving average, the bot closes the short position.
The bot makes decisions based on a 5-minute candlestick and executes trades accordingly.
